# gh-actions-lock

Lock your workflow dependencies.

## Background

gh-actions-lock is part of GitHub's Workflow Dependency Pinning effort. It gives repositories a lockfile that pins every workflow dependency to a verified commit, so what runs on the runner is exactly what you locked. Development is ongoing and behavior may still change.

Contributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Requirements

Requires the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/). Install it first, then install the extension:

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-actions-lock
```

## Usage

Scan every workflow under `.github/workflows/` directory, pin each resolvable action to a SHA, and update the lockfile:

```bash
gh actions-lock
```

After the initial run to onboard workflows, you will need to run `gh actions-lock` when:
- A new workflow is created that has `uses` dependencies.
- An existing workflow adds or removes `uses` dependencies.

Pins to branches or partial versions (e.g. `main`, `v4`) are trusted from the
lockfile and not re-resolved on a normal run. To bump them to the current
upstream commit, run:

```bash
gh actions-lock --relock
```

`--relock` re-resolves refs that have legitimately moved and rewrites the
lockfile to the new SHA. Suspicious pins whose recorded commit is no longer
reachable upstream are left as errors — use `--accept-moved` to re-resolve
those as well.

### Self repository actions (`$/…`)

`uses: $/…` references an action or reusable workflow in the **same repository** as
the defining file, resolved at the **running commit**. Because it always resolves to
that repository's running SHA it is **inherently pinned** — no lockfile entry is
required, and it is valid anywhere a relative `./…` reference is:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: $/actions/my-action          # same-repo action, inherently pinned
jobs:
  call:
    uses: $/.github/workflows/reusable.yml  # same-repo reusable workflow
```

A trailing `@ref` (e.g. `$/actions/my-action@v1`) is rejected — the ref is always
the running commit.

To convert existing same-repo `./…` composite action references to `$/…`, run with
`--migrate-local-actions`. This rewrites `./…` steps both in your workflows and in
your in-repo composite action definitions (`action.yml`). Only `./…` paths that
resolve to an in-repo action file are rewritten:

```bash
gh actions-lock --migrate-local-actions
```

## How it works

A repo gets a lockfile (located at [`.github/workflows/actions.lock`](https://github.com/github/gh-actions-lock/blob/main/.github/workflows/actions.lock)) and workflows are onboarded to the lockfile on a per-workflow basis. 

Workflows that are onboarded to the lockfile enforce that all dependencies are present in the lockfile and guarantees that the locked commit for an Action is what's executed on the runner. Lockfiles are also verified for forgeries. The sha must exist in the refs it's stated to exist in. Repository identity is recorded and redirects and mismatches are blocked at runtime. 

Finally, locked actions must have a branch that the commit being locked exists within. This is to make impostor commit style attacks harder.

## Limitations

There are currently eligibility limitations for workflows that can be onboarded to lockfiles:
- Workflows in the lockfile cannot use local-path actions, these will be skipped for onboarding. This is also a short-term gap.
