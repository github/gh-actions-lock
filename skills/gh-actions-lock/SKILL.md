  Locks and verifies GitHub Actions workflow dependencies with gh-actions-lock.
  Use when onboarding a repository to .github/workflows/actions.lock, fixing or
  relocking the lockfile, verifying it in CI, reading its findings, or whenever a
  user mentions actions.lock, gh actions-lock, or pinning workflow dependencies.

# gh-actions-lock

`gh actions-lock` is a [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) extension that pins every direct and
transitive action a repository's workflows use to a verified commit, recorded in
`.github/workflows/actions.lock`. It is pre-1.0: flags and behavior can change between releases.

## Setup

github.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency
(`*.ghe.com`) are supported; GitHub Enterprise Server is not.

```bash
gh extension install github/gh-actions-lock
```

Run every command from the repository checkout. The host comes from `--hostname`, then `GH_HOST`,
then the current repository (`GH_REPO` or a remote), then github.com.

## Modes

| Command | Writes | Network | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gh actions-lock` | yes | yes | onboarding and fixing the lockfile |
| `gh actions-lock --relock` | yes | yes | advancing moved refs to current upstream commits |
| `gh actions-lock --verify` | no | yes | CI: same checks as a fix run, fails on anything blocking |
| `gh actions-lock --verify-local` | no | no | pre-commit: every `uses:` has a lockfile entry |
| `gh actions-lock --no-fix` | no | yes | read-only report |

`--verify-local` only checks coverage, not that entries are trustworthy. Use `--verify` in CI.
`--verify` and `--verify-local` are mutually exclusive, and `--verify-local` cannot be combined
with `--relock` or `--accept-moved`.

Pass workflow paths to scope a run: `gh actions-lock .github/workflows/ci.yml`. Only a
full-directory run prunes entries for deleted workflows.

## Onboarding and fixing

```bash
gh actions-lock                 # pin every resolvable action and write actions.lock
gh actions-lock --verify        # confirm
git add .github/workflows/
```

- Rerun after adding a workflow or changing any `uses:`. Locked pins are sticky: a plain run only
  resolves refs the lockfile doesn't record yet.
- Partial versions (`v4`) are narrowed to the highest matching full tag (`v4.2.1`) when first
  pinned. `--no-narrow` keeps them as written.
- Writes are all or nothing. If any error remains that the run can't fix, it changes nothing,
  not even for workflows that are otherwise fine.
- Commit `actions.lock` together with any workflow edits the run made.

**Local `./…` actions.** The CLI never follows, locks or rewrites a workspace path. When a local
action in the checkout uses remote actions, every mode reports a blocking `local-action` error.
Fix it with one of:

```bash
gh actions-lock --migrate-local-actions   # rewrite same-repo ./… to $/… so they get locked
gh actions-lock --ignore-local-actions    # keep ./… and downgrade it to a warning
```

`$/…` refers to the same repository at the running commit and needs no lockfile entry. A `./…`
inside a remote composite can't be rewritten, so only `--ignore-local-actions` applies there.

## Relocking and moved refs

```bash
gh actions-lock --relock        # re-resolve every ref to its current upstream commit
```

`--relock` advances floating refs (`main`, `v4`), fixes `tag-commit-mismatch`, and rebuilds each
composite's dependencies from its manifest. It leaves `unreachable-pin` as an error: the locked
commit is no longer in the ref's history, which is either an upstream force-push or an edited
lockfile, and the CLI can't tell which.

`--accept-moved` accepts those pins at their current commit. **It is a human decision.** Only
run it after the user has checked why the commit moved, and never in CI, scheduled jobs, or other
automation, where it would silently accept a tampered pin.

## Exit codes and JSON

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Nothing to fix, or every finding was fixed |
| 1 | Blocking findings remain; the report is well-formed |
| 2 | The tool itself failed (bad flag, IO, auth, malformed lockfile); read stderr |

```bash
gh actions-lock --verify --json 2>/dev/null
```

JSON goes to stdout and progress to stderr; parse only stdout. `--json` alone selects
`valid,findings,workflows`. Pass a list to choose from `valid`, `findings`, `workflows`,
`dependencies`, and `pins`. Finding fields include:

```
workflow, category, severity ("error" | "warning" | "info"), confidence,
dependency, required_by, detail, remediation, doc_url, retryable
```

A run is invalid exactly when some finding has severity `error`; warnings and info never block.
`retryable: true` means GitHub was unreachable or rate-limited: rerun later rather than editing
anything.

## Reading findings

Act on each finding's `remediation`, and open its `doc_url` before deciding. Don't guess from the
category name alone.

| Category | Usual next step |
|---|---|
| `not-pinned`, `stale`, `ref-changed`, `repo-renamed` | `gh actions-lock` |
| `ref-moved`, `tag-commit-mismatch`, `incomplete-lockfile` | `gh actions-lock --relock` |
| `unreachable-pin` | stop and ask the user; see `--accept-moved` above |
| `misleading-sha`, `repo-replaced` | stop and ask the user; don't relock or accept |
| `ref-missing`, `invalid-workflow`, `invalid-self-repository-ref` | fix the workflow source |
| `repo-unavailable` | deleted, or the token can't read it; check access |
| `ancestry-unknown`, `reachability-unknown` | retryable; rerun later |
| `local-action` | see local actions above |
| `container-image`, `version-ref`, `fresh-tag` | non-blocking; mention to the user |

## CI

Copy [`.github/workflows/verify-lockfile.yml`](https://github.com/github/gh-actions-lock/blob/main/.github/workflows/verify-lockfile.yml)
into the repository, then run `gh actions-lock` once so the new workflow is locked too. It runs
`gh actions-lock --verify` on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
The job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` reads public actions and the repository itself; actions
from other private or internal repositories need a token that can read them.

## Limits

- Reusable workflows called at `jobs.<id>.uses` from another repository are not locked.
- Local `./…` actions and their dependencies are outside lockfile coverage.
- Container images are not pinned; anything without an `@sha256:` digest is a warning.
- A floating ref locked to an older commit in its history isn't detected. Review lockfile diffs or
  pin exact tags.
